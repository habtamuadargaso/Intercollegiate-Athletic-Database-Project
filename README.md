# Intercollegiate-Athletic-Database
```
The IntercollegiateAthleticDatabaseis an MYSQL relational database for the intercollegiate
to support the scheduling and operation of the event. It contains eight tables: categories ,
Employee, Customer, Facility,Location, ResourceTbl,EventRequest,
EventPlan,EventPlanLine. The EventRequesttableis the hub of the database. An event
request represents an event scheduled at a facility. For example, a basketball game may be
scheduled at the gymnasium. Events are sometimes scheduled several months in advance.
Holding an event requires resources including personnel and equipment. Resources are assigned
to specific locations of a facility. For example, guards may be required at the gates of the football
stadium. The EventPlan table defines a plan for the setup, operation, and cleanup of an event.
The EventPlanLine table contains the individual resources required in an event plan.
